# Hi, I'm Thoufeek Hussain 👋

### AI & Payments Product Manager | MSc in Data Science & AI 👋

Product leader, ex-founder, and MSc in Data Science & AI who ships AI-first products that move business metrics. I design and launch agentic AI apps, payments flows, and data-driven features — from prototype to production — with a bias for measurable impact.

## What I do

* Lead payments & checkout strategy across multiple GCC markets (checkout → auth → reconciliation → post-purchase).
* Build agentic AI apps, RAG & multi-agent systems, and Streamlit prototypes that power real user outcomes.
* Turn messy domain problems (e-commerce, construction, accounting, ops) into scalable product experiences.

## Personal Projects

* **Coyn** — AI personal financial advisor (multi-agent).
* **MAPP** — Multi-Agent Project Planner (CrewAI + Streamlit).
* **AI Resume Builder** — Tailored resume + cover-letter generator for PMs.
  (Repos and demos in this org — pull, run, iterate.)
